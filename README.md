Hello, welcome to my GitHub profile. My name is Henry Barreto, and I'm a 23-year-old programmer. Here, I expose my projects, ideas, configuration files, and my dubious code.


For me, programming is not just my job, but also my way of life. I ever wanted to know how the things work under the hood; see the gears spinning, and I have found at programming a way to do that and make money. Combining business with pleasure.


Today, I'm a Back-end developer with knowledge compatible to this role. I also know a bit about the core technologies for the Front-end as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a bit of React. I have tried to be a “Full-stack developer”, but I truly love the bytes instead of the “sizes”.


> Yes, I how to use a CSS's grid and how to center a div. It is not normal, I know.


I am ever looking for new things to learn and try out, sometime I think I am doing it too much, what could be harmful to me, but I believe that the best way to improve myself professionally and personally.


The contributions of many people to the open-source community have helped me a lot, even though I never see anyone. As a way of trying to give back to the community, I created my blog, https://henrybarreto.dev/, in an initiative to practice my poor English and to share what I have been learning, in the hope that it will help someone else.


I have a special lust for human languages. I consider it to be the primal human ability. It's something I can't explain properly, but I've read somewhere else that it frames how people think, act, and live. It's fascinating to me.


There are many things about me, but it is enough for now. :D
