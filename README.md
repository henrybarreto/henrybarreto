Hi, welcome to my Github profile,

I'm Henry Barreto, I'm a 23 years-old programmer, here I expose my projects, ideas, configuration files and my Bolognese code.

For me, programming is not just my job, but also my Hobby. It is a thing I have ever liked to do, since I knew it when I had wanted to program games.
In addition to that, I ever wanted to know how the things work under the hood; see the gears, I exercise this everyday, ever looking to know, "How this works", due to that, I believe programming was a perfect match to me.

Today, I'm a Back-end developer with knowledge compatible to this role, but I know a bit about the core technologies for the Front-end as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a bit of React. That is why I tried to be a front-end developer, but I truly love the bytes instead of "sizes".

*Yes, a Back-end dev who knows how to use a CSS's grid and how to center a div, it is not normal, I know.*

I am also ever looking for new things to learn and try out. Because I believe that the best way to learn something is practice. 

*My broken Linux distros will confirm it to you!*

By the way, since I have begun, the contributions of many people to the open-source community have helped me a lot, even I never see anyone. Therefore, I try to retribute the max I can to the community. In my Blog, https://henrybarreto.dev/, I try to share what I have been learning and some helper articles.

Regards,
