Welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Henry Barreto, and I am a back-end developer with a passion for low-level programming and a admiration for human languages. Here, you'll find a variety of projects I've been working on, from experimenting with Rust to building web applications with Node.js. I also like to share my config files and some dubious code that I've written along the way.

As a back-end developer, I am currently working on a SaaS system called ShellHub, which was recognized by Linux Magazine as the "SSH of the 21st century". While I am not an advocate for open-source, I do believe in the value it brings to the development community.

In my free time, I am actively working to improve my skills in Rust, with the goal of becoming a professional in this language in the future. I am also always looking to improve my skills in Go and related technologies. Additionally, I have a deep interest in human languages and believe that they play a fundamental role in how we think, act, and live.

To document my learning experiences, I created my blog https://henrybarreto.dev/. On my blog, I share my progress and knowledge in the hope that it will help others on their own journey. I invite you to check it out and follow my progress.
