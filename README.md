**Welcome to my GitHub profile!**

Hello, my name is **Henry Barreto**. I am a passionate **Back-end developer** with a keen interest in low-level, web __(.*)__ programming and a deep admiration for human languages. Here, you'll find an assortment of projects I've been working on, ranging from _Rust_ experimentations to _Go_ and _Node.js_ one's. I also enjoy sharing my configuration files and even some quirky code I've crafted along the way.

As a back-end developer, I am currently working on a SaaS system called _ShellHub_, which was recognized by Linux Magazine as the "SSH of the 21st century". While I am not an advocate for open-source, I do believe in the value it brings to the development community.

During my free time, I'm actively honing my skills in _Rust_ with the ultimate goal of becoming a proficient professional in the language. I'm also continually seeking opportunities to enhance my expertise in _Go_, my primary language, and related technologies.

To document my learning experiences, I've created a blog at https://henrybarreto.dev/. Through my blog, I share my progress and knowledge, hoping to assist others on their own journeys. I warmly invite you to explore my blog and follow along with my growth.
