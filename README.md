Hi, welcome to my Github profile. I'm Henry Barreto, I'm a 23 years-old programmer, here I show my projects, ideas, configure file and my Bolognese code.

For me, programming is not just my job, but also my Hobby. It is a thing I have ever liked to do, since I had known It when I had wanted to program games.

I ever want to know how the things work under the hood; see the gears, do you know what I mean? I exercise this everyday, ever looking to know, "How this works".

Today, I'm a Back-end developer who know a bit about the core technologies for the Front-end. Yes, a Back-end dev who knows how to use a CSS's grid and how to center a div, it is not normal, I know.

I am also ever looking for new things to learn and try out. You know, the best way to learn something is practice. My broken Linux distros will confirm it!

By the way, since I have begun, the contributions of many people to the open-source community have helped a lot, even I never see anyone. Therefore, I try to retribute the max I can to the community. In my Blog, https://henrybarreto.dev/, I try to share what I have been learning and some helper articles.

I believe that decentralized technologies is the future, but I understand that centralization is needed in many systems.
