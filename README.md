Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile. My name is Henry Barreto, and I'm a 23-year-old programmer. Here, I expose my projects, ideas, configuration files, and my dubious code.

Today, I'm a Back-end developer with knowledge compatible to this role. I also know a bit about the core technologies for the Front-end as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a bit of React. I have tried to be a “Full-stack developer”, but I truly love the bytes instead of the “sizes”.

> Yes, I how to use a CSS's grid and how to center a div. It isn't normal, I know. 

The contributions of many people to the open-source community have helped me a lot, even though I never see anyone. As a way of trying to give back to the community, I created my blog, https://henrybarreto.dev/, in an initiative to practice my poor English and to share what I have been learning, in the hope that it will help someone else.


I have a special lust for human languages. I consider it as the primal human ability. It's something I can't explain properly, but I've read somewhere else that it frames how people think, act, and live. It's fascinating to me.
